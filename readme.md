Kata solutions with problem description in the corresponding .js file located in the "solutions" folder.
Sample tests for the functions located in the "tests" folder.
To run the tests for a specific function edit the package.json file and change the test key:value pair by editing the pair to be the corresponding test file to run i.e. "tests/isogram_test" runs the isogram_test.js file in the tests folder. Type npm test to run the script.

For the time being using the mocha  framework for testing and the default node 'assert' module for assertions, should be sufficient to test the functionality.
